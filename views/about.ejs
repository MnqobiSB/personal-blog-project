      		<!-- about the author starts -->
      		<p>My name is Mnqobi and I am from South Africa. I am the founder of <a href="/">Suburban Digi Hustle</a>. I am a professional web developer and digital marketing consultant. My journey that led me to starting this platform may sound clich√©, but it is the real story. Being a South African I would say is one of the inspirations for me to decide to blog about my passion and knowledge. This is because in my local environment, the knowledge that I posses is not very effective and the society and small business owners are still catching up to the real digital world potential.</p> 
      		<p>So I figured that my knowledge is better of shared online where my audience that want it can access it. I have spend years of my time researching the market and being part of the market and I find most fullfillment in sharing my knowledge. I am still learning more as a person and want to make sure that I provide my audience with the best and latest insights possible.</p>
