      			<h2 class="section-title">The Founder</h2>
	      		<p>My name is Mnqobi and I am from South Africa. I am the founder of <strong><a href="/">Suburban Digi Hustle</a></strong>. I am a professional <em>Web Developer</em> and <em>Digital Marketing Consultant</em>. I have been working as a freelancer for a couple of years now and have helped multiple companies in my area to reach their <em>digital</em> goals.</p>

	      		<p>My journey that led me to starting this platform may sound clich√©, but it is the real story. Being from a small town called Bethlehem is one of my biggest <em>inspiration</em> that led me to start this blog sharing my <strong>passions and expertise</strong>. Other inspirations being my love for sharing information and helping people.</p>

	      		<p>Because I wanted to reach a <em>larger audience</em>, I had this idea of <a href="">starting a blog</a> and sharing my knowledge <em>online</em>, where anyone that wants it can access it.</p> 

	      		<p>I have spent years <em>researching</em> the market and being part of the market and I find most <strong>fullfillment</strong> in sharing my knowledge with others.</p>

	      		<p>I am still learning more as a person and want to make sure that I provide my audience with the best and latest insights possible.</p>
